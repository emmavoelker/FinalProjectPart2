# Final Project Part 2

### Wireframes & Storyboards 

### User Research and Interviews 
#### Components of the Research Protocol 
Target audience: 1) Parents with children in K-12 schooling 2) Casual art enjoyers 3) Art Educators 

In identifying representative individuals to interview, I wanted to interview some Heinz College peers, as they are also studying arts management and would not only be interested in the topic, but have a stake in the results. 

I also interviewed someone who does not fall into my defined "target audience" to observe if they had any additional comments or criticisms that my target audience did not identify. Coming from a different background, I was curious to see if he had any additional insight into both the results of the data and the way that it was presented. Some of my target audiences likely have a background in the arts, or are at least aware of any key statistical facts.

Within my storyboard, I determined a set color scheme for the final project, as well as a font family I'd like to use. The Georgia font family is one commonly found in online applications and is available on ShortHand. 

The included photos come from a report by Americans for the Arts, found here: https://www.miarted.org/pdf/AFTA-Arts-Education-Navigator-Facts-Figures.pdf The photos demonstrate the type of visualizations that I'd like to include within my own visuals and storytelling. I like the usage of call-out statistics for effect and emphasis, and that the majority of included visuals emphasize a particular aspect of the data. They are not overcrowded or attempt to display large amounts of information at a time. Rather, these visuals showcase a particular aspect of the data that is then dissected with meaningful dialogue and context. For example, the circle graph visual calls out dropout rates for students in low-income schools. The visual could have easily been overcrowded by the inclusion of data like the names of particular schools, or a breakdown of specific arts classes. Instead, the data is simple and meaningful, and audiences are able to easily read the visual while understanding the importance and implication of data points.
