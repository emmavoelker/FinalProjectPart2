# Final Project Part 2

### Wireframes & Storyboards 
In creating my new storyboard, I realized my scope in the previous one was too long, and there were a bit too many breakdowns of data that were likely unnecessary. For this updated storyboard, I took out some unneeded sections that probably clogged the story rather than helping to tell it. The current storyboard is below, with each heading (and working title) boxed in gray. Each section is marked on the left side in either purple or green, indicating text (green) and graphics (purple). The colors assist in determining the flow of the project and to ensure that the visuals are being properly supported and explained with accompanying text.

Examples of a few data visualizations include the following (sources to be added into the final versions of the visuals). I plan to use a combination of Canva and Tableau. Canva will be used for call-out statistics and simpler visualization with a larger design element, and Tableau will be used for the more data-intensive visuals. 

As we discussed in class on Thursday, I also plan to utilize RAWGraphs in some capacity. I like the idea of implementing more "fun" visuals and testing out a new software for learning purposes. As indicated on my outline, I would like to do so in the Graphic number five if applicable.

### User Research and Interviews 


#### Components of the Research Protocol 
Target audience: 1) Parents with children in K-12 schooling 2) Casual art enjoyers 3) Art Educators 

In identifying representative individuals to interview, I wanted to interview some Heinz College peers, as they are also studying arts management and would not only be interested in the topic, but have a stake in the results. 

I also interviewed someone who does not fall into my defined "target audience" to observe if they had any additional comments or criticisms that my target audience did not identify. Coming from a different background, I was curious to see if he had any additional insight into both the results of the data and the way that it was presented. Some of my target audiences likely have a background in the arts, or are at least aware of any key statistical facts. 

In conducting the interviews, I was curious to measure the audience's interest in the subject, and whether my current flow/storyboard served that intended purpose. I also wanted to test for topic understandability, and the knowledge that my target audience might be already bringing to the experience, and what gaps might need to be filled. 

#### Interview Script & Findings 
##### Script
(When prompted with a few examples of the data visualizations and the story board)
1) What do you think this topic is about?
2) Who do you think the primary audience for this particular project is?
3) What types of data visualizations would you expect to see accompany this data?
4) What types of feelings would you expect to feel learning about this topic? (suprised, angry, neutral, interested)


#### Implemented Changes  
d. the findings from your interviews; and 
e. changes you plan on implementing to your visualizations next week to address the issues identified.

### Moodboard 
![Mood Board](https://github.com/emmavoelker/final_project_EmmaVoelker/assets/149551887/d695165e-0387-47ff-8f5d-45fde2756d30)

Within my storyboard, I determined a set color scheme for the final project, as well as a font family I'd like to use. The Georgia font family is one commonly found in online applications and is available on ShortHand. 

The included photos come from a report by Americans for the Arts, found here: https://www.miarted.org/pdf/AFTA-Arts-Education-Navigator-Facts-Figures.pdf The photos demonstrate the type of visualizations that I'd like to include within my own visuals and storytelling. I like the usage of call-out statistics for effect and emphasis, and that the majority of included visuals emphasize a particular aspect of the data. They are not overcrowded or attempt to display large amounts of information at a time. Rather, these visuals showcase a particular aspect of the data that is then dissected with meaningful dialogue and context. For example, the circle graph visual calls out dropout rates for students in low-income schools. The visual could have easily been overcrowded by the inclusion of data like the names of particular schools, or a breakdown of specific arts classes. Instead, the data is simple and meaningful, and audiences are able to easily read the visual while understanding the importance and implication of data points.
